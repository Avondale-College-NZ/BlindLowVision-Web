### What is contained in this repository ###
This repository contains html pages, MSSQL queries javascript scripts and php scripts, which are all dependant on one another.
## Dependencies and Requirements ##
To reporoduce this project the following are needed:
<ul><li>A PHP compatible web server running PHP 7.3 or later with MSSQL drivers enabled <br><i> See <a href="#info"><b>info </b></a> for further web server details</i>
<li>Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge etc. ( not Internet Explorer v11 )
<li>Reliable internet connetion
<li>MSSQL Server</ul>

*It must be noted that the php scripts connection strings for the MSSQL database in this repository will need to be changed to your database*

## Info ##
To set up the web server I personally used Microsoft IIS due to its great intergration into the Windows OS. XAMPP can be used as well, but i ran into difficulties regarding setting up the MSSQL drivers necessary to run the php scripts.<br>
[Microsoft Web Platform Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx) made installing the required dependencies easy in comparison to other methods.
